### Online Tamagotchi Application:
The user can take care of an 8 bit pet and then battle them against friends to shop for  fun prizes or other Tamagotchi! If your pet isnâ€™t taken care of well enough it will lose stamina, become dissatisfied, or even run away. Conversely, tending to all their needs will allow them to become a true battle master and climb the ranks of the battle board.

### Necessary Tech:
 - sql container
 - run cyber_pet 
 - run java application (use IntelliJ or Eclipse)
 - run UI code in VS Studio
    - Node.js
    - npx install
    - npm start 

#### Biggest bugs:
 - pets do not evolve over time
 - health stats do not change over time
 - can battle same pet
 - battle winner does not gain gold
